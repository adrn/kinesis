Abstract:
    We use absolute trigonometric parallaxes from the Hipparcos Catalogue
    (Cat. <I/239>) to determine individual distances to members of the
    Hyades cluster, from which the 3-dimensional structure of the cluster
    can be derived. Inertially-referenced proper motions are used to
    rediscuss distance determinations based on convergent-point analyses.
    A combination of parallaxes and proper motions from Hipparcos, and
    radial velocities from ground-based observations, are used to
    determine the position and velocity components of candidate members
    with respect to the cluster centre, providing new information on
    cluster membership: 13 new candidate members within 20pc of the
    cluster centre have been identified. Farther from the cluster centre
    there is a gradual merging between certain cluster members and field
    stars, both spatially and kinematically. Within the cluster, the
    kinematical structure is fully consistent with parallel space motion
    of the component stars with an internal velocity dispersion of about
    0.3km/s. The spatial structure and mass segregation are consistent
    with N-body simulation results, without the need to invoke expansion,
    contraction, rotation, or other significant perturbations of the
    cluster. The quality of the individual distance determinations permits
    the cluster zero-age main sequence to be accurately modelled. The
    helium abundance for the cluster is determined to be Y=0.26+/-0.02
    which, combined with isochrone modelling including convective
    overshooting, yields a cluster age of 625+/-50Myr. The distance to the
    observed centre of mass (a concept meaningful only in the restricted
    context of the cluster members contained in the Hipparcos Catalogue)
    is 46.34+/-0.27pc, corresponding to a distance modulus
    m-M=3.33+/-0.01mag for the objects within 10pc of the cluster centre
    (roughly corresponding to the tidal radius). This distance modulus is
    close to, but significantly better determined than, that derived from
    recent high-precision radial velocity studies, somewhat larger than
    that indicated by recent ground-based trigonometric parallax
    determinations, and smaller than those found from recent studies of
    the cluster convergent point. These discrepancies are investigated and
    explained.
